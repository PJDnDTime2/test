  <div>
    <h2>Player Queue</h2>
    <p>Register to play in this Friday's episode of <strong>Pete & Jeremy's DnDTime</strong>. Signups are open between Friday and Wednesday. The chosen players no a given week are announced on Thursday on <a href="#discord">discord</a>. The first game each week has special priority for new players, so don't be afraid to sign up if you've never played with us before! The second and third games follow our normal player selection process - A player's priority to play is based on their points. Points are earned by watching <a href="https://twitch.tv/dndtime" target="_blank">our stream</a>. Every time a player participates in <strong>Pete & Jeremy's DnDTime</strong>, their point total is halved. If you sign up, but don't get into a game, you'll recieve 10 consolation points to help you get in next time.</p>
    <p>Sign up each week that you wish to be considered to play. The queue resets every week after that week's players are announced!</p><br>
